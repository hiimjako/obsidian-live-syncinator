# Obsidian Live Syncinator
The Obsidian-Live-Syncinator is a plugin for Obsidian that keeps your workspace in synchronization across multiple devices, live and in real-time that aims to eventually consistency. 
It depends and requires [syncinator-server](https://github.com/hiimjako/obsidian-live-syncinator-server) to be deployed. Follow the documentation to set it up.

# Why the Name?
Drawing inspiration from the inventive naming style of Heinz Doofenshmirtz (Phineas and Ferb).
# TODO

- Add sync for configurations
	- Add also a settings page to decide what to sync
- Support other file types, not only markdown.
- Fix consistency on startup, to align local offline changes
